<H1>Installation</H1>

<p>Double click on the installation file and follow the instructions.

<p>After install, you should have:
<ul>
  <li>Under a root directory (usually <b>FastFieldSolvers</b> under 'Program Files' folder in the English version of Windows, but you could have chosen a different path during installation), a structure containing the four directories <b>FastModel</b>, <b>FasterCap</b>, <b>FastCap2</b> and <b>FastHenry2</b>. These directories contain the executable files, the help files and the licenses. Due to Windows user's policies, standard users cannot modify the content of these folders.
  <li>Under the 'Shared Documents' folder (in the English version of Windows XP, this usually is 'C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Shared Documents', or in Windows Vista and Windows 7, this usually is the folder 'Public'), visible and fully accessible to all users, a root directory called "FastFieldSolvers" containing three folders <b>FasterCap</b>, <b>FastCap2</b>, <b>FastHenry2</b>. In these folders you'll find the samples related to the three programs. Please take some time to browse around and get accustomed with the contents.
</ul>  

<p>Moreover, the install program will add the FastCap2 and FastHenry2 utilities path in your Windows path variable. So you will be able to launch any of these utilities (described in the manuals) from a DOS shell open on any directory.
