<H1>Editing FastHenry2 Files</H1>

<p>You can modify your FastHenry2 input files in the FastHenry2 View. 

<p>As you type, you will notice that the text will be automatically colored according to the semantic meaning of the command; that is, color highlighting is not performed on a simple token basis, but is fully context-sensitive.

<p>In this way, you will see highlighted in red the instructions that would generate an error when parsed with FastHenry2; therefore you will be able to correct them in advance.

<p>To update the FastModel View according to the changes you make to the input file, right-click the mouse while the cursor is on the FastHenry2 View and select <b>Update Model</b> from the pop-up menu.

<p>To save, select <b>File->Save FastHenry2 File</b> or <b>File->Save FastHenry2 File As</b> from the main menu.
