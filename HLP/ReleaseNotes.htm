<H1>Release Notes</H1>

<p>In the current version, FastModel handles FasterCap, FastCap2 and FastHenry2 input files; however, the FastHenry2 import routine treats nonuniform ground planes as single blocks only.

<p>FastModel is built to be fully integrated with FasterCap, FastCap2 and FastHenry2. It is possible to launch FasterCap, FastCap2 or FastHenry2 on the file opened in FastModel by simply clicking a button.

<p>FastModel projects are not supported in this release, that is, you won't be able to save your environment.

<p>We kindly ask you to <A href="mailto:support@fastfieldsolvers.com">report us any bug </a>; please be as specific as possible in the bug description and provide, if you can, the input file responsible for the error. This will greatly help us.

<p>Of course, also any other comment, request or suggestion is welcome!
