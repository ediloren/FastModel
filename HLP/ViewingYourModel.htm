<H1>Viewing Your Model</H1>

<p>The FastModel View windows allows you to see and move in real time the 2D or 3D representation of your FasterCap/FastCap2/FastHenry2 input files.

<H2>Move around your model</H2>

<p>As soon as you have imported an input file or have typed in something and performed an <b>Update Model</b> operation, you will be able to view your model in the FastModel View(s), zoomed to fit into the window. Then you can move around your model; to do so, use the left mouse button together with the shift and control keys:

<ul>
  <li>to pan the image, click the mouse left button and move the cursor
  <li>to zoom in and out, hold down the control key while clicking the mouse left button and moving the cursor up and down
  <li>to rotate the model around the center of the view, hold down the shift key while clicking the mouse left button and moving the cursor
  <li>rotate the model around you, hold down the shift and control keys together while clicking the mouse left button and moving the cursor
</ul>

<p>If you get lost while moving (i.e. you cannot see the model any more), click the right button while on the FastModel View and select <b>Zoom All</b> from the pop-up menu.

<H2>FastModel View options</H2>

<p>You can also select other options from the pop-up menu:

<ul>
  <li>under <b>Display</b> you can select to remove or not the hidden lines or to have a solid view of your object
  <li>under <b>View</b> you can select to have a 2D or 3D view
  <li>under <b>Autoset 2D</b> you can automatically rotate the model (only when in 2D mode) to show orthographic views
  <li>under <b>Properties</b> you can set colors for your current View
</ul>

<H2>Add FastModel Views</H2>

<p>You can also add as many FastModel Views as you want. Each View is independent from the others, that is, can have different point of view, 2D/3D settings, display mode and colors. 
<br>To add new views, select <b>Window->New window</b> from the main menu.

<H2>Print, print preview and exporting images</H2>

<p>You can also print and print preview your model exactly as you see it in the FastModel View of your choice; just select 'Print' or 'Print Preview' from File drop down menu.
<br>You can also print directly to an Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file, useful for direct inclusion in your documents: EPS is a vector picture format, so you can zoom or scale the picture without loss of resolution. You can open the EPS file with a PostScript viewer (like the freeware GhostView) or directly import it into your document. 
<br>For instance, in MS Word, select <b>Insert->Picture->From File</b> on the main menu to import the picture into a sheet.
