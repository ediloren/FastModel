<H1>Load FastHenry2 input files</H1>

To load a FastHenry2 input file:

<ol>
  <li>Select the FastHenry2 View (the view should be in foreground with the caption highlighted).
  <li>From the <b>File</b> menu select <b>File->Open FastHenry2 File</b> or click on the <img src="images/openicon.png"> icon on the toolbar.
  <li>Browse to the 'Shared Documents' folder (in the English version of Windows XP, this usually is 'C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Shared Documents', or in Windows Vista and Windows 7, this usually is the folder 'Public') and under <i>FastFieldSolvers\FastHenry2</i> select the file <i>30pin.inp</i>, then click <b>Open</b>.
</ol>

<p>The cursor will change to a glasshour until the file is imported into FastModel. As soon as the import finishes, you should be able to see the 3D model of the 30-pin connector in the FastModel View.
<p>You will also notice that the FastHenry2 View now contains the input file and that the file has been colored according to the input semantic. You can type in the view and see the colors change according to what you write.

<ol>
  <li>Select the FastHenry2 View and from the <b>File</b> menu choose <b>File->Close FastHenry2 File</b> to close the file.
</ol>
