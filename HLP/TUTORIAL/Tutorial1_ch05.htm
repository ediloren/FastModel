<H1>Zoom, rotate and pan the model</H1>

<ol>
  <li>Load the FastHenry2 <i>30pin.inp</i> sample file as described in <a href="Tutorial1_ch03.htm">Load FastHenry2 input files</a>.
  <li>Bring the FastModel View in foreground. The cursor should be a crosshair.
  <li>Press and hold down the <b>Ctrl</b> key. The cursor changes to the zoom icon. Holding down the <b>Ctrl</b> key, left-click the mouse while moving the mouse up or down. You should see the model zooming in or out.
  <li>Press and hold down the <b>Shift</b> key. The cursor changes to the rotate icon. Holding down the <b>Shift</b> key, left-click the mouse while moving the mouse up/down or left/right. You should see the model rotate on two axes around the origin.
  <li>Press and hold down the <b>Shift</b> key and the <b>Ctrl</b> key together. The cursor changes to the rotate near icon. Holding down the <b>Shift</b> key and the <b>Ctrl</b> key, left-click the mouse while moving the mouse up/down or left/right. You should see the model rotate, but this time the rotation is subjective, that is, the model rotates around your point of view, as if you were moving your head to have a look around.
  <li>Left-click the mouse without pressing any key and move the mouse up/down or left/right. You should see the model pan.
  <li>Right-click the mouse to bring up a pop-up menu and choose <b>Zoom All</b> to restore the initial view.
