<H1>Run FastModel and navigate its panels</H1>


<H2>Launch FastModel</H2>

<ol>
  <li>If FastModel is not already running, double click the FastModel icon on your desktop or select 'FastModel' from your <b>Start</b> menu in Windows.
  <li>Click on the <b>I agree</b> button to accept FastModel's license.
</ol>


<H2>FastModel View</H2>

The FastModel View is the main window where the model is shown and can be manipulated. It usually has a gradient background (but you can apply your preferences). The View should be empty since we have not loaded any model yet.

<ol>
  <li>Move the around view and resize it according to your preferences
</ol>

<H2>FastCap2 View</H2>

The FastCap2 View shows the textual input file for FastCap2. If you cannot see the view, perform the following steps:

<ol>
  <li>On the <b>View</b> menu, select <b>View->FastCap2 View</b>.</li>

You can try writing in this window. Probably, you'll notice that what you type is marked in red. This is because FastModel is syntax-checking the text and marks unknown statements as errors.

  <li>Move around the view and resize it according to your preferences.</li>
</ol>

<H2>Browser Window</H2>

The Browser Window shows the hierarchy of the input files loaded into FastModel. If you cannot see the window, perform the following steps:

<ol>
  <li>On the <b>View</b> menu, select <b>View->Browser Window</b>.
</ol>

This window can be left floating, docked to the sides of the frame window, moved and resized. If you double click on the FastHenry2 or FastCap2 icons, the FastHenry2 and FastCap2 views will pop up.
<p>The Browser Window will show all the input files that you have loaded into FastModel (at the moment none).

<H2>Output Window</H2>

The Output Window shows any message FastModel will issue during file import or update. These messages are usually warning or error messages related to the input files.

<p>You can test the Output window in the following way:

<ol>
  <li>Bring to front the FastCap2 View, either selecting <b>View->FastCap2 View</b> or by double clicking on the FastCap2 icon in the Browser Window
  <li>Write something in the FastCap2 View 
  <li>Right click the mouse with the cursor on the FastCap2 View area and select 'Update Model' on the pop-up menu
  <li>Examine the Output Window: it should contain some error messages
</ol>
